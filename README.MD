# CU QCA Fall Fest 2023
Welcome to the CU Quantum Computing Association's Qiskit Fall Fest event page!
## What is Fall Fest?
The Qiskit [kiss-kit] Fall Fest is a mixture of hackathons, challenges, and workshops related to quantum computing, held at various universities around the world. We are proud to be supported by IBM Quantum and their quantum software devlopment kit, Qiskit.

Our Fall Fest event will involve guided challenges & workshops. It will be held in-person on the Cornell Ithaca campus in Phillips 203, from 10am-4pm. All guided challenges will be written in Python using Qiskit.
